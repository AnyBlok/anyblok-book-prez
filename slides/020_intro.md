**AnyBlok** is a Python framework allowing to create highly
dynamic and modular applications on top of the SQLAlchemy ORM.

Applications are made of “bloks” that can be installed, extended,
replaced, upgraded or uninstalled.

Bloks can provide SQL Models, Column types, Fields, Mixins, SQL views,
or even plain Python code unrelated to the database, and all of these
can be dynamically customized, modified, or extended without strong
dependencies between them, just by adding new bloks.
